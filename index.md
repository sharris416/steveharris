## Steve Harris

I am a Digital Marketer, Developer, Instructor, AI Researcher, Writer, and overall Digital Citizen.  Basically, I'm just this guy with a lot of hats. You can read more about my background and research on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevencharris/).

I have long been interested in Geographic and Spatial Research and Visulaizations, and especially in the exciting ways they can be used with machine learning and, in combination with marketing research, provide new ways to learn about the world.

This Portfolio documents my journey into GIS learning, and I am excited to share it.
